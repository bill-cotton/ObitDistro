   Installing and running Linux binary distribution of Obit

1) Unpack the distribution tarball in the directory in which you wish
   to install it; e.g.
 > mv obit-distro-1.1.561.tar.gz /home/mydir/obitinstall
 > cd /home/mydir/obitinstall
 > tar zxf obit-distro-1.1.561.tar.gz

2) Add the top level distribution to your path:
 > setenv PATH "/home/mydir/obitinstall/obit-distro-1.1.561/bin:$PATH"
if you use tcsh or, for bash
 > PATH="/home/mydir/obitinstall/obit-distro-1.1.561/bin:$PATH"; export PATH
You may wish to add these to your .cshrc or .profile login files.

3) ObitTalk is the python based user interface, documentation is in
doc/ObitTalk.pdf.

4) Additional customization is possible using the python file
dot.obitrc.py renamed to .obitrc.py and placed in your home directory
($HOME) or in the working directory from which you run ObitTalk.
This can be used to define the location of AIPS and AIPS data
directories as well as FITS data directories.  Alternatively, the
standard AIPS startup scripts will define the AIPS environment.

5) If the host has a version of python in /usr/bin/python, the
distributed versions of the scripts will use it.  Otherwise 
/home/mydir/obitinstall/obit-distro-1.1.561/lib/obit/bin/ObitTalk 
needs to be modified at the end to use an available python.
